### Lending Club
###Project Background

Lending club is a peer-to-peer platform that matches people looking to borrow with people willing to lend. 

###Objective

Our goal remains to build a strategy that will enable an investor to select and build a portfolio of loan notes, say 5 to 10, that maximizes the rate of return of the portfolio given a risk profile of the investor.  We will continue to work to achieve this objective as outline in the plan below.
